  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/icons/bottom/
    - assets/icons/ordenation/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/categories/
    

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: "Nunito Sans"
      fonts:
        - asset: "assets/fonts/googleFonts/Nunito-Sans/Nunito-Sans-200i.ttf"
          style: "italic"
          weight: 200
        - asset: "assets/fonts/googleFonts/Nunito-Sans/Nunito-Sans-300i.ttf"
          style: "italic"
          weight: 300
